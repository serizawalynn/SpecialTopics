Repo for final project for NYU undergraduate course MATH-UA 396 Special Topics (Modeling in Science, Engineering, and Economics)

The following are descriptions for the files in the repository:

1. 1DRouteMap.pdf
   This is an image showing how we converted a 2D map of path for the Thanksgiving Parade into a 1D line. Every dot represents a turn. To accomplish this, the 2D map was cropped and rotated to make the path a line.
2. Recitation10_1DTrafficFillln.m
3. Road.m
   This file was for an idea to create a class for roads. However, the 1D conversion of the map proved to be easier.
4. convoycatchup.m
   This script simulates a convoy encountering multiple obstacles but are ordered to maintain a certain distance between vehicles.
5. drunk.m
   This script simulates a scenario where one driver's velocity oscillates, propagating its effects to the vehicles behind them. We do not condone driving under the influence, and the name of the script was a result of fatigue caused by finals.
6. pothole.m
   This script simulates a convoy encountering multiple obstacles.
